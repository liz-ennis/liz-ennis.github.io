![Because I care.](/images/2026-02-13-because-i-care.jpg)

I wheel my mother through the doorway into the Geriatrician's waiting room. I look around. Elderly people with vacant faces sit beside stressed middle -aged carers - all women, daughters I assume.

My mother has Parkinson's Disease. After her diagnosis she moved from her home 7 hours away to live 10 minutes from us. That was 13 years ago.

A few years ago a P.E.T. scan revealed what we already knew - she also has dementia.

I read about daughters wanting to care for their mothers in appreciation of the love and support they received growing up.This is not my story.

I love my mother, but my relationship with her has always been fraught with angst. She is difficult and not particularly maternal.

After she left my father, she had many relationships. When a new man was on the scene, everything else became a low priority - including her daughters and grandkids.

My partner thinks my mother doesn't deserve the sacrifices I've made for her - and he's right. But there is no-one else.My sister lives interstate and all the boyfriends left her, long gone.

Dealing with the dementia as well as Parkinson's has added a whole new layer to this situation. My mother has constant hallucinations and confabulations which are not pretty, but is still very much aware of who we are.

Her paranoia is off the charts. All the male carers are sexually assaulting her and the staff talk about her all the time. She is sharing a room with a family of 6 and is going to be kicked out of her room.

As I write she keeps phoning me but when I pick up there is no response.

I'm not sure my family and friends understand the impact that my carers role has had on me.It's exhausting and quite isolating at times.

( And did I mention I have 7 adult kids, 3 adult step kids and 8 grandkids?) 

I am living in a generational sandwich.
