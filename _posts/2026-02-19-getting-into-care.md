Even as adults, the  desire for parental approval exists deep within us. Is this the reason I tried so hard to give my mother what she wanted? (To stay in her 'little house')

And try I did! I worked my butt off to procure home support. Initially she was awarded a level 3 home care package but as providers fees eat up a third of the allocated money and mum's health was declining, I pushed for a level 4.

Sadly this was still insufficient. During this period my mother suffered many, many falls. Admission to hospital became a regular event. Still she was resistant to any talk of full time care. 

I persuaded her to look at some facilities with me. I wanted her to see what 'homes' looked like now - very different to the place she worked at in the 80's.

Only one place earned a reluctant tick of approval. At the end of our tours she announced that she had no intention of ever going into care and had only agreed to placate me.

Then she went on to say that family care for family - that she had done this for her mother- my beloved Nanna.

Nanna was only 64 when she died. (I still miss her) She spent the final 2 years of her life in a rural hospital not far from where we lived.

My mother ( aged in her late 30's/ early 40's) visited regularly but was not responsible for Nanna's daily needs, medication, appointments and care management.
